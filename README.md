# final_aab_uplaod

A new Flutter project.

This is the first version and flutter frontend of Ribence-The Web Scanner App where you can host your own websocket channel (read docs:https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) 

Unfortunatelty, I have removed the WebSocket channel link because it is free hosting and I don't want any unncessary traffic. 

You can create chat apps, chat bots and use web-socket channel to receive and send data to the backend. 

I also cannot share the latest version of the app, I'm sorry :( 

This is Ribence-The Web Scraper App V1
